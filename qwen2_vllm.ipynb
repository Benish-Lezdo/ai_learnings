      "\n",
      "This patient presents today for follow-up and presents with a translator and a nurse case manager who is here for this one-time visit only. The patient states that she feels worse than her initial date of injury which was June 3, 2023. She rates her pain 9/10 which she claims remains at 9/10 the entire time. The pain involves her entire right upper extremity with numbness down to her fingers. The pain is made worse with lifting. She has trouble sleeping. She has had 8 sessions of physical therapy with no improvement. She saw Dr. Hanna the orthopedic surgeon for the right shoulder impingement but he ordered a scan of her neck to rule out pathology coming from the neck and this was an abnormal study. According to my verbal communication with Dr. Hanna's office today, Dr. Hanna felt that the majority of her pain was stemming from her neck and not the shoulder. The patient disagrees with this because she states that her neck was not hurting prior to this injury. He referred her to pain management and currently has an appointment with pain management on April 6 however it is for the neck which is not an excepted body part. I had to explain to the patient that she needs to go to her\n",

      "Patient presents today for follow-up on her right shoulder and states that she feels about the same and rates her pain 8/10 which remains at 8/10 because she is not receiving any medications as they are not approved according to what the pharmacist tells her. She has a follow-up coming up with Dr. Hanna but she also has not had the acupuncture that he had recommended and he wanted to see how she responded to that before going on to the next level of plan. Unfortunately she will see him without having any acupuncture performed because we have requested it twice with no authorization. The pain is described as pulsating, sharp, dull and pressure-like. The pain is constant. The pain is made worse with movements of her shoulder. Associated signs or symptoms she has which she describes as a sharp tingling pain with certain movements. Her range of motion has not changed at all from her last visit. She continues to have positive impingement signs on that shoulder. I suspect that she will require a Mumford procedure\n",

      "This patient presents today for follow-up on her right shoulder impingement syndrome. The patient states there has been absolutely no change in her condition. She completed 12 sessions of physical therapy or occupational therapy and this made no difference whatsoever. It did not help her at all. She is also had a cortisone injection which did not benefit her. She has not had any acupuncture because we have been waiting on it to get approved. She has already seen Dr. Hanna the orthopedist and he did recommend surgery but he wanted to get an MRI of the neck first to make sure that the problem was not stemming from her neck. The patient has had an MRI of the neck in December. She has a follow-up with Dr. Hanna on March 5 and she has an upcoming appointment for an EMG on March 1. She states she has a lot of difficulty brushing her hair, sleeping and getting dressed because it is difficult to raise that arm and she cannot raise it all the way. On examination her forward flexion remains at 90 her abduction remains at 80 and the rest of the exam remains identical to last visit. She has positive impingement signs. She will remain on TTD with refill on her medications and follow-up here in 2 weeks time. I just reviewed the MRI of the cervical spine and there\n",

      "This patient was evaluated here in our clinic for her right shoulder impingement syndrome with radiculopathy and right upper arm sprain. Patient states she still having lots of pain and it is causing her some distress in her shoulder and is radiating up into her neck. States her pain is a 9 out of 10 and she is not getting any relief because she has not got her medications as of yet. The medicines were sent to the pharmacy but they did not give her the medications. She has seen the orthopedic specialist she can remember what was said but she wants to get better as soon as possible. She states she has some constant numbness and tingling in her right hand in the palm and the fingers. Please see her physical exam for specific range of motion measurements. So after this evaluation here in the clinic we will continue on her current work restrictions and medicine regiment. We will give her refills of her naproxen, Tylenol and Flexeril for inflammation, pain and muscle spasms respectively. As you await the notes from the orthopedic specialist we will continue on her current work restrictions. We will set up for an in clinic reevaluation with us in 3 weeks.\n",

She also has undergone two separate sessions of physical therapy that did not help to improve her symptoms. She reports continued right-sided neck pain that causes constant discomfort in the shoulder, elbow, and hand. She reports whole hand numbness. She reports that the discomfort is constant. She reports that when she turns her head to the left she will experience pain in the right side of her neck that radiates into the shoulder, elbow, and hand area. She also reports that the cortisone injection that was previously performed help to improve her symptoms approximately 20% for approximately seven days.\n",

These impairments are being treated with therapeutic activities, therapeutic exercise, neurologic re-education, manual therapy and modalities. The patient's current impairments are affecting the patient's ability to perform activities such as walking, standing, bending, lifting objects of any weight, and reaching. The patient's participation in daily life and meaningful activities is restricted due to challenges with work-related tasks, household activities and recreational activities. Addressing the identified impairments, functional limitations, and participation restrictions will improve the patient's overall function and quality of life. The treatment focus will be on increasing pain-free C/S ROM and UE strength, while improving the patient's ability to participate in work activities, as well as activities of daily living. Patient was able to verbalize understanding of plan of care. Patient would benefit from skilled PT.\n",

The pain has not subsided and she continues to do activities at work that are outside of her work restrictions. She gets told certain things that she feels are inappropriate by her supervisor. She has failed a previous cortisone injection that was given to her by Dr. Hanna. Dr. Hanna requested pain management but that was denied. She starts her first physical therapy session on December 28. She has been taking her medications naproxen and Tylenol. Her pain level is 8/10 decreases to 6/10 for about 4 hours when she takes Tylenol and naproxen together. Pain is made worse with any repetitive movements or raising her arm. Associated signs or symptoms: the pinching sensation and tingling with certain movements. MRI reveals that she has an impingement syndrome at the subacromial level. This would clearly explain her symptoms that increase her pain in the shoulder with repetitive movements especially raising her arm. She needs to start physical therapy and I am also going to be prescribing or recommending acupuncture to reduce her pain. She will refill her medications and will follow-up in 3 weeks time. I need to send her back to Dr. Hanna or another orthopedist if she fails acupuncture as a treatment for impingement syndrome is a Mumford procedure which means a distal clavicle resection which is surgery.\n",

Patient states her pain level is an 8 out of 10 goes to a 5 out of 10 intermittently with her medications. States the pain can be sharp burning, throbbing, or pressure-like with intermittent numbness and tingling in the right second through fifth fingers. Patient did see the orthopedic specialist who told her that she had significant arthritis in her shoulder and she needed to see a pain management specialist as well as have more physical therapy for her shoulder. I think the also want to give her a Zionexa machine for topical anti-inflammatory for her shoulder. Muscle electrical stimulation machine also. Please see her physical exam for specific range of motion measurements. So after this evaluation here in the clinic we will continue on her current work restrictions and medicine regiment. We will add Voltaren gel to her regiment patient did have an MRI done and we will try and get the report from Desert advanced imaging. As we await the authorization for pain management, physical therapy and the PRP injections, we will set her up for an in clinic reevaluation with us in 2 weeks.\n",

Patient states that her pain level is an 8 out of 10 its intermittent but is a sharp burning type pain. She states she has numbness and tingling in all 5 of her fingers intermittently. She has not got her medications so she has not had any improvement in her pain. She says that the pharmacy told her they needed to get a approval for her medicines. Please see her physical exam for specific range of motion measurements. So after this evaluation here in the clinic we will continue on her current work restrictions and medicine regimen. We will put in request for her to have naproxen and Tylenol for inflammation and pain respectively. We will also put in request for her to have Flexeril for muscle spasms. As we await the authorization for her to see the orthopedic specialist we will resubmit that because it has been almost 6 weeks with no response.\n",

Patient states her pain level is an 8 out of 10 goes to a 6 out of 10 for about 4 hours after taking her medication. She states she has episodes of sharp burning throbbing and pressure-like pain in her right shoulder that radiates down into her right elbow. She also has intermittent numbness and tingling in all 5 of her fingers on the right hand. Patient was set up to have an MRI but found out she had a cochlear implant so we cannot do the MRI. Please see her physical exam for specific range of motion measurements. So after this evaluation here in the clinic we will continue on her current work restrictions and medicine regiment. We will give her naproxen Tylenol and Flexeril for inflammation pain and muscle spasms. Patient will receive also Voltaren gel topical ointment to use also. We will put in request for her to have a CAT scan of her right shoulder due to her cochlear implant and she cannot have an MRI. We will set her up for an in clinic reevaluation with us in 3 to 4 weeks.\n",

The patient presents today complaining of constant, moderate to severe right shoulder pain and weakness, accompanied by a pinching sensation that is exacerbated by overhead reaching.\n",

      "At this time, I am requesting authorization for a right shoulder MRI without contrast and a consultation with a shoulder specialist.\n",

      "Additionally, I am requesting authorization for an InfraRx™ Far Infrared Heat Pad System for home use, to be used at least once daily for 30-45 minutes per session. This treatment aims to promote healing by delivering deep-penetrating far infrared heat to damaged tissues (refer to supporting studies below). This FDA-registered therapeutic device facilitates acute/chronic pain management, reduces inflammation, and improves mobility and daily activities. Additionally, InfraRx™ provides a non-pharmacological option for pain relief, thereby potentially decreasing dependence on medications.\n",

Its proven effectiveness, safety, ease of use, and compliance with MTUS guidelines make it an essential component of the patient's treatment plan.\n",

      "Today, I am also prescribing the patient with a topical NSAID solution/gel, along with Lidocaine patches in efforts to manage pain and/or inflammation, as well as reduce oral NSAID intake. Side effects from topical medications are much less severe than those from oral NSAIDs, and are often limited to rashes, itching, or a burning sensation at the application site. The medications are non-compounded topical medications, effective in providing relief throughout the duration of this patient's treatment.\n",
