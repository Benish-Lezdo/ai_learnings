The patient was given antibiotics and was positioned. \\xa0The patient was\\npositioned and the area of interest was shaved, prepped, and draped under sterile condition. \\xa0We utilized a spinal\\nneedle and fluoroscopy to localize the correct spinal level and location of the incision. \\xa0The incision was marked and\\ninjected with Marcaine with Epi %0.5, 5cc. \\xa0SSEP and MEP were obtained at the beginning of the procedure and\\npositioning.\\nThe incision was made using a 10 blade knife. \\xa0The fascia was exposed carefully.\\xa0 The fascia was carefully opened\\nto expose the spinous process and the lamina on the affected side.\\xa0 The lamina was exposed to the level of the\\npars and just shy of the facet capsule that was preserved.\\nWe identified the level of the spine and the side with fluoroscopy. \\xa0The L5-S1 was targeted on RIGHT .\\nUnder microscopic magnification, laminotomy was performed of the upper level using high speed drill, kerrison, and\\ncurettes. \\xa0The ligamentum flavum was exposed.\\xa0 Care was taken to keep the pars intact. \\xa0Medial facetectomy was\\ndone using osteotomes.\\xa0 The ligament flavum was carefully elevated and removed. The lateral recess was\\ndissected and decompressed.\\xa0 The transverse process of the lower level was delineated as well as the facet joint.\\nThe lateral aspect of the facet joint was directed and drilled off.\\xa0 The attaching fascia to the facet joint and top of the\\nTP was dissected and reflected.\\nLaminotomy of the lower level was performed following the dura and the traversing exiting nerve root.\\xa0 This lower\\nlevel laminotomy was extended inferiorly until the dura appeared to be decompressed and we were able to see the\\ntakeoff of the exiting nerve root.\\nWe followed the nerve root and performed a foraminotomy by careful dissection around the nerve and removing the\\nligaments and the bony anatomy from around the nerve.\\xa0 This dissection and decompression was continued until\\nthe nerve appeared well decompressed into the foramen.\\nL5-S1 disc was exposed. The nerve and the dura was retracted medially and we inspected the underlying disc.\\nThere was disc herniation that was noted compressing on the neuronal elements.
